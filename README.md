# MPR
matlab script to study micro-patterning and roughness

The "original" branch is intended as a space to maintain the first MPR version with an analytical wavy surface.
I expect  new features to be implemented into other branches (e.g., as of Feb-March 2023) : 
 - trench : surface parameters for a trench, IADs from PIC, improved particle emission...
 - master : read any surface geometry (e.g., from AFM) ...
 Therefore I only expect to need this branch if we have to get back to square 1
